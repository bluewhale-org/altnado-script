# Altnado

[Altnado](https://www.altnado.com) generates image text automatically for all images on your site with a single line of code. All you have to do is [sign up for an account](https://www.altnado.com/signup) and include a script in the header of your pages.

### altnado-script

This repository contains the static script file hosted on a CDN for Altnado. The contents of this repo are hosted on `https://s.altnado.com`.

### Usage

Example script usage:
```
<script defer site-id="SITEID" src="https://s.altnado.com/a.js"></script>
```

You can find your `SITEID` on the Altnado dashboard after logging in for a specific site.

### Contributing

For any minor fixes, please create a pull request directly. For larger changes, please create an issue to discuss the change before submitting it. If you find a security vulnerability, please practice responsible disclosure and contact us directly at `security@altnado.com`.

If you have any suggestions for Altnado (the product), not just the image updating script, please reach out at `contact@altnado.com` or the live chat support on the bottom right corner of [the website](https://www.altnado.com) to discuss instead of opening an issue here.
